# ARTG120-Project

Greenhouse Granny is an endless action platformer. A mysterious incident has caused giant plants to run rampant through the city, and only you, the legendary Keeper of the Greenhouse, can stop them. Wield your trusty shovel, leaf blower and sun hat to take down as many plants as you can; then upgrade your stats using the money you've earned and play again.

Made my Simon Katzer, Jack Cuneo, Matthew Tolentino and Trystan Nguyen.
